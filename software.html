      <p class="body-font" style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;">
              We present SAMARA - Software <u>and</u> Modeling Aggregating Research Assistant
              <br>
              <br>
              SARA, the Software Aggregating Research Assistant, was created based on the inspiration to develop a database of iGEM software, to allow for the simplified searching and management of past iGEM software projects. SARA provides the opportunity for old software to be updated and improved to stay current and decreases the likelihood that teams will create redundant software.
              <br>
              <br>
              However, due to our understanding that software is only a piece of the pie that caters to lab work and synthetic biology, we at Beesensor sought to improve on this great software to meet the needs for another major piece of the lab and that is modeling.
              <br>
              <br>
              iGEM teams have become experts at utilizing various modeling techniques and types from computational, to mathematical and even protein modeling. SARA was useful to our team when trying to discern and avoid creating the same software. However, what we found laborious, and challenging was discerning a model we could use or mimic for our project.
              It was also quite hard to filter what types of models were used and for what sort of project.
              <br>
              <br>
              Thus, we created SAMARA, the Software and Modeling Aggregating Research Assistant. SAMARA offers a similar platform to that of SARA where there is still the opportunity to look up software done by prior iGEM projects. However, we add on to it by also providing an opportunity by storing in the database models and their type used by iGEM teams.

        <h2 style="color:black;margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">How would SAMARA work?</h2>
        <p class="body-font" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
        <br>
        Playing off SARA, SAMARA would make use of a web scraper that finds software and models from iGEM wikis using the standardized address for iGEM wiki pages, the desired year, the list of teams, and the Software and Modeling suffix.
        For software, the Scraper would visit the software page of the iGEM teams and identify if there exists content and would be recorded. A similar algorithm would likewise be implemented to scrape a description of the software from the team pages.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2018, iGEM Calgary tried three different approaches to get the description of the software projects. Firstly, their strategy involved grabbing the first 500 words on the software page. However, there existed inconsistencies in the format and presentation of information. The second strategy was to use various machine learning algorithms to extract important sentences from the pages, but this did not create a cohesive or coherent narrative as the sentences were often taken out of context. Their last strategy involved manually reading and paraphrasing the information on the software pages.
        We would investigate implementing other machine learning algorithms to see if they can circumvent the tedious task of manually reading our pages while also ensuring that the descriptions are accurate.
        <br>
        <br>
        For model storage, like the Software mechanism the Scrapper would visit the modeling page of iGEM teams and if there exists content, it would record it. However, a defining factor of this implementation would be that the scrapper would also be programmed to identify types of models used by the teams. By identifying key words such as kinetic modeling, protein modeling, computational modeling, mathematical modeling. Thus users of SAMARA would also be able to filter out what types of modeling techniques were used by the teams. To better improve our search results, we would implement or create, test, and train a machine learning algorithm in collaboration with our scrapper that can accurately do this job.
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, we aim for SAMARA to be a tool that can help iGEM teams and the wider synthetic biology community have access to software and models they can use in their lab work and greatly reduce workload, redundancy and allow for easier look up for software and models.
