    <h1 style="color:black;">Hardware Project:</h1>

    <h2 style="color:black;margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Overview:</h2>
    <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
    The Beesensor technology is composed of two main hardware components: a sensor electrode and the diagnostic device.
    <br>
    The sensor electrode is composed of an integrated gold electrode. Our team will explore screen printed electrode to be integrated into the sensor. Our implementation method is inspired from iGEM 2019 NAWI Graz's beeosensor. Although the team contemplated between purchasing a complete device for EIS measurement or building the device on their own using chemical integrated circuits, they chose the second alternative as it met the requirement of low price. For the Beesensor, although screen printed electrodes are commercially available, we will explore methods to fabricate our own screen printed electrode, to allow the accessibility of the sensor in terms of cost.
      <br>
      Thiolated aptamers immobilized on gold nanoparticle modified graphite and gold screen printed electrodes will be explored for the detection of <em>P.larvae</em>. Based on existing studies, main challenges with electrochemical aptamer-based biosensor are the enhancement of aptamer immobilization amount, target accessibility, and useful detection signals. Gold nanoparticles are ideal for bioconjugation, as they are biocompatible and readily bind to variety of biomolecules. The immobilization of these nanoparticles on the electrode increases the surface area, thus promoting adsorption capability of the electrode. Gold nanoparticles increase sensitivity as they act as nanoscale electrodes that electrically communicate between bioreceptors and bulk electrode materials.
      <br>
      The efficient immobilization of the thiolated aptamer on Au NPs is of great importance for the successful development of the aptasensor.
      Thiol chemisorption would be the process of immobilizing the aptamers onto the electrodes. Backfilling method to increase sensitivity. These aptamers are immobilized on the working electrode layer
      
      EIS – electrical impedance spectroscopy would be used to measure
Then the diagnosis device: “A device for the measurement of the difference of the charge transfer resistance of a sensor electrode with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) should be developed (resistance with bounded spores vs resistance without them)”(iGEM 2019 Team NAWI_Graz).
 So in terms of diagnostic device, it seems to be two options:
First Option: An electrochemical workstation that (  an electrochemical impedance spectrometer) measures the impedance generated in the sensor electrode. This device is connected to some electronic device like a laptop where a software shows the impedance measurements in graphical and quantitative form. We can modify this to then show the measurements for p.larvae.
 Second option: Create or have a device that combines both the spectrometer and the display device that gives the readings into one thing.
