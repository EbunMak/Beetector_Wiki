    <h2 style="color:black;margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Overview:</h2>
    <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
    The Beesensor technology is composed of two main hardware components: a sensor electrode and the diagnostic device.
    <br>
    <br>
    The sensor electrode is composed of an integrated gold electrode. Our team will explore screen printed electrodes to be integrated into the sensor. Our implementation method is inspired from iGEM 2019 NAWI Graz's Beeosensor. Although the team contemplated between purchasing a complete device for electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement or building the device on their own using chemical integrated circuits, they chose the second alternative as it met the requirement of low price. Similarly for the Beesensor, although screen printed electrodes are commercially available, we will explore methods to fabricate our own screen printed electrode, to increase accessibility of the sensor in terms of cost.
      <br>
      <br>
      Thiolated aptamers immobilized on gold nanoparticle modified graphite and gold screen printed electrodes will be explored for the detection of <em>P.larvae</em>. Based on existing studies, main challenges with electrochemical aptamer-based biosensor are the enhancement of aptamer immobilization amount, target accessibility, and useful detection signals. Gold nanoparticles are ideal for bioconjugation, as they are biocompatible and readily bind to variety of biomolecules. The immobilization of these nanoparticles on the electrode increases the surface area, thus promoting adsorption capability of the electrode. Gold nanoparticles increase sensitivity as they act as nanoscale electrodes that electrically communicate between bioreceptors and bulk electrode materials.
      <br>
      <br>
      The efficient immobilization of the thiolated aptamer on gold nanoparticles is vital for the effectiveness of the aptasensor. Thiol chemisorption is used to immobilize the aptamers on the working electrode layer, in conjunction with backfilling method, which will serve to enhance diagnostic sensitivity. Subsequently, EIS is used for quantitative detection of <em>P.larvae</em>.
      <br>
      <br>
      Inspired by the 2019 NAWI Graz's diagnostic device, our team will also explore a device to measure the difference of charge transfer resistance of a sensor electrode with EIS. Our diagnostic device will consist of electrochemical workstation (electrochemical impedance spectrometer) that measures the impedance generated in the sensor electrode. This device is connected to an electronic device where a software will show the impedance measurements in graphical and quantitative form. We can modify the recevied signals to then show the measurements for <em>P.larvae</em>.
