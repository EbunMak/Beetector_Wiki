    <br>
    <br>

        <h3 style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Our experimental design was based on the findings and limitations of this study conducted by Chen et al.:</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="body-font" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
      Essentially, we are using a functional nucleic acid which is our aptamer. This is selected from random sequence libraries by using the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) techniques.
      The reason we are using this technique in comparison to traditional antibody detection methods is because aptamers are more thermally stable, and easier to modify and amplify in comparison to antibody detection methods.
      The system we plan on testing is called the Aptamer-Based Cell-free Detection (ABCD) system, it detects target proteins, and in the study, they targeted epithelial cell adhesion molecule proteins (EpCAM) as an example. We would use this system for our target protein which is Spla as previously mentioned.
      Ideally, we would combine the ABCD system with CRISPR-Cas12a so that we could have both a recognition probe and a signal amplifier.
      So now on to the actual experiments,
      <br>
      First, we would have to synthesize oligonucleotides:
      <br>
      </p>
      <img src="table1.png" style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;" height=500px alt="table" class="center" >
      <p class="body-font" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
      <h3 class="body-font" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Then we have to prepare various buffers and reagents as seen below:</h3>
    </p>
        <p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%; font-size:20px">
          <br>
      - Prepare nucleic acid dye, electrode (in the study they did streptavidin-coated Fe3O4 magnetic beads) but an electrode is a potentially better option because ​​the double-strand complex can be immobilized. Additionally, we need to prepare Spla, AsCas12a protein, DNase I, and premix powder of 1× PBS.
      <br>
      <br>
      - We also have to prepare Duplexing Buffer (used in forming double-strand complex) by adding 5 mM MgCl2 into 1× PBS buffer.
      <br>
      <br>
      - We have to prepare the Washing and Binding Buffer which is used in washing magnetic beads and binding the double-strand complex onto electrodes - this contains 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100; pH 7.8.
      <br>
      <br>
      - We have to prepare Incubation Buffer which is used in binding aptamer and target protein) and is prepared by adding 0.05 mM MgCl2 into 1× PBS buffer.
      <br>
      <br>
      - Prepare 5× Trans-cleavage Buffer (used in reactions that Cas12a involved) contained 100 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM KCl, 25 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 25% glycerol, 250 μg/mL heparin; pH 7.5
      <br>
      <br>
      - Lastly, we have to make sure that all buffers are filtered before use.

      <br>
      <br>
      - Attach a polarizer to the exit of the excitation light, and attach another polarizer to the receiving inlet of the emission light to make sure the polarization directions of the two polarizers were vertical/parallel.

      <h2 style="color:black;margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Challenges & Considerations for Replication</h2>

      <p class="body-font" style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">
      - The low stability of crRNA limits its application, and is the largest practical application challenge for the ABCD system
      <br>
      <br>
      - Though there is no example for Cas12a now, chemical modification has been proved efficient in increasing Cas9′s gRNA stability
      <br>
      <br>
      - The complementary strand binding to aptamer depends not only on the number of complementary nucleotides but also the salt concentration
      <br>
      <br>
      - ABCD system's stability may be affected by salt concentration, pH, and temperature; Using the same buffer conditions and temperature in aptamer selecting will greatly reduce the associated challenges.
      <br>
      <br>
      - Additionally, identifying new aptamers with higher affinity and specificity to the target molecules will improve the efficiency of the ABCD system.
      <br>
      <br>
      - Modification of RNA's nucleotides with functional groups would increase its stability
      <br>
      <br>
      - Experiments should be replicated with varying volumes and incubation times.
