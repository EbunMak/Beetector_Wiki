      <h2 style="color:black;margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">EXPERIMENTAL WORKFLOW</h2>
      <p class="body-font" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
        Our experimental design was based on the findings and limitations of this study conducted by Chen et al.:
      Essentially, we are using a functional nucleic acid which is our aptamer. This is selected from random sequence libraries by using the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) techniques.
      The reason we are using this technique in comparison to traditional antibody detection methods is because aptamers are more thermally stable, and easier to modify and amplify in comparison to antibody detection methods.
      The system we plan on testing is called the Aptamer-Based Cell-free Detection (ABCD) system, it detects target proteins, and in the study, they targeted epithelial cell adhesion molecule proteins (EpCAM) as an example. We would use this system for our target protein which is Spla as previously mentioned.
      Ideally, we would combine the ABCD system with CRISPR-Cas12a so that we could have both a recognition probe and a signal amplifier.
      So now on to the actual experiments,
      </p>

      <p class="body-font" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
      Then we have to prepare various buffers and reagents as seen below:
    </p>
        <p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%; font-size:20px">
      - Prepare nucleic acid dye, electrode (in the study they did streptavidin-coated Fe3O4 magnetic beads) but an electrode is a potentially better option because ​​the double-strand complex can be immobilized. Additionally, we need to prepare Spla, AsCas12a protein, DNase I, and premix powder of 1× PBS.
      <br>
      - We also have to prepare Duplexing Buffer (used in forming double-strand complex) by adding 5 mM MgCl2 into 1× PBS buffer.
      - We have to prepare the Washing and Binding Buffer which is used in washing magnetic beads and binding the double-strand complex onto electrodes - this contains 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100; pH 7.8.
      - We have to prepare Incubation Buffer which is used in binding aptamer and target protein) and is prepared by adding 0.05 mM MgCl2 into 1× PBS buffer.
      - Prepare 5× Trans-cleavage Buffer (used in reactions that Cas12a involved) contained 100 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM KCl, 25 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 25% glycerol, 250 μg/mL heparin; pH 7.5
      - Lastly, we have to make sure that all buffers are filtered before use.

      </p>



<p class="body-font" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Next up we have to run our agarose gel electrophoresis and perform a molecular hybridization
Procedure:
</p>
<p class="body-font" style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">
- Mix equal equivalent (100 pmol) of aptamer (SYL3C-Biotin) and C3-FAM/C4-FAM mixed
- Heat to 95 °C for denaturing for 10 min.
- Anneal to room temperature slowly.
- Perform agarose (3%) gel electrophoresis subsequently with nucleic acid dye supplemented in advance when making the gel
- Obtain gel image via Bio-Rad Molecular Imager® Gel Doc™ XR System.
</p>

<p class="body-font" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Then we have to do a fluorescence anisotropy:
</p>

<p class="body-font" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Procedure:
</p>

<p class="body-font" style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">
Mix 100 pmol aptamer (SYL3C-FAM) with 55 pmol Spla in Incubation Buffer to the volume of 200 μL.
Then incubate the reaction system at 37 °C for 40 min.
Measure the fluorescence intensity of parallel/vertical direction by Shimadzu® RF-6000. In the Chen et al. study, the polarizers were from a pair of 3D glasses.
Attach a polarizer to the exit of the excitation light, and attach another polarizer to the receiving inlet of the emission light to make sure the polarization directions of the two polarizers were vertical/parallel.
For reference: The excitation wavelength is 495 nm, and the range of emission wavelength is from 500 nm to 600 nm.
Use Incubation Buffer as the control group to replace the Spla in this test.
</p>

<p class="body-font" style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">
Then a competition reaction,
</p>


<p class="body-font" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Procedure:
</p>

<p class="body-font" style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">
  Use the aptamer (SYL3C-Biotin) and C3-FAM to form a double-strand complex by molecular hybridization.
  Use the electrode with an appropriate volume and wash them using the Washing and Binding Buffer according to the manual of electrodes.
  Then add the Incubation Buffer for the competition reaction followed by supplementing 20 pmol Spla.
  After incubation at room temperature for 40 min, remove the supernatant of the reaction system to measure fluorescence intensity by Shimadzu® RF-6000.
  For reference: The excitation wavelength is 495 nm, and the range of emission wavelength is from 500 nm to 600 nm.
  The Positive Control is C3-FAM to show the obvious high fluorescence signal.
</p>

<p class="body-font" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Then a trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a
</p>

<p class="body-font" style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">
  Use various concentrations (20, 2, and 0.2 pmol) of C3 to activate the trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a.
  Pre-mix 1 pmol AsCas12a, 2 pmol crRNA-C3, and ssDNA reporter for 30 min at room temperature.
  Then add C3 and 5× Trans-cleavage Buffer to reach a final volume of 200 μL.
  Measure the fluorescence intensity immediately by Tecan Infinite® M200 Pro.
  For reference: The excitation wavelength is 485 nm, and the emission wavelength is 535 nm. Recording time was set as 440 s and interval time was set as 20 s.
  Use DNase I as the Positive Control to cut off the ssDNA reporter in this test.
</p>

<p class="body-font" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
And lastly, an integrated experiment:
</p>

<p class="body-font" style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">
  Use the aptamer (SYL3C-Biotin) and C3 to form a double-strand complex by molecular hybridization.
  Use electrodes of appropriate volume and wash using the Washing and Binding Buffer according to the manual of electrodes.
  Then add the Incubation Buffer for the competition reaction followed by supplementing varying moles (10, 15, and 20 pmol) of Spla.
  After incubation at room temperature for 40 min, remove the supernatant of the reaction system and add in the pre-mix of 1 pmol AsCas12a, 2 pmol crRNA-C3, and ssDNA reporter in 5× Trans-cleavage Buffer.
  Measure the fluorescence intensity immediately by Tecan Infinite® M200 Pro.
  For reference: The excitation wavelength is 485 nm, and the emission wavelength is 535 nm. Recording time was set as 1180 s and interval time was set as 20 s.
