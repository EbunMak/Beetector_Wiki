splA Plasmid
    <br>
    <a>https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/I0BWH5</a>
    <br>
The splA S-layer protein is found to be key to the virulence of ERIC II genotypes of P. larvae, as weâ€™ve heard from HP contacts the ERIC II genotype is not present in Alberta or North America for that matter. Thus we looked to find a protein in the ERIC I or more genotypes of P. larvae. Potential proteins that are important to the virulence strategies of P. larvae have been identified in this 2019 study of exoproteins, such as toxins Plx1 and Plx2, chitin-degrading protein PlCBP49, ADP-ribosyltransferase C3larvin toxin, and Plx2A has been shown to be a C3-like toxin. For the purposes of this wiki assignment, we have chosen to use splA due to more literature being present on it but acknowledge we would look into the proteins listed above or perhaps others to find a more appropriate protein. This protein will be secreted and purified through the use of the His-tag attached, we can then place the protein onto a matrix for aptamer-binding.

Cas12a Plasmid
    <br>
    <a>https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/A0Q7Q2</a>
    <br>
    <a>http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2872019</a>
    <br>
The reason we choose Cas12a instead of Cas9 is that Cas9 requires two RNA molecules: tracrRNA and a crRNA, whereas Cas12a requires only a single RNA molecule. Even though Cas9s tend to have naturally higher fidelity, Cas12 is more compact and efficient. It also processes its own guide RNAs, leading to increased multiplexing ability. This protein will be secreted and then purified through the use of the His-tag attached, there is also a protease recognition site that will allow us to snip off the His-tag to allow proper functionality of Cas12a.

  pSB1C3 - Plasmid
    <br>
    <a>http://parts.igem.org/Part:pSB1C3</a>
    <br>
pSB1C3 is a high copy number plasmid as well as being the plasmid that iGEM requires all competition submissions be made with.
    <br>
    <br>
CmR - Chloramphenicol Resistance Gene
    <br>
    <a>https://www.snapgene.com/resources/plasmid-files/?set=basic_cloning_vectors&plasmid=pSB1C3</a>
    <br>
CmR is a gene for resistance to the antibiotic, chloramphenicol, it is already present in the pSB1C3 plasmid.
<br>
    <br>
Promoter
    <br>
    <a>http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J23100</a>
    <br>
This is a Constitutive Promoter compatible with E. coli. These are non-toxic proteins that are being produced in-lab for our own purposes so a Constitutive Promoter was used.
<br>
    <br>
    RBS
    <br>
    <a>http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_B0030</a>
    <br>
This RBS was used by a lot of other projects.
    <br>
    <br>
His-Tag
    <br>
    <a>http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1223006</a>
    <br>
His-tags are attached to both proteins to allow for purification.
    <br>
    <br>
Terminator
    <br>
    <a>http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_B0010</a>
    <br>
Forward Terminator, a Bidirectional Terminator would have been chosen but the parts on the iGEM registry for some reason did not have the sequence of the parts.
    <br>
    <br>
VF2 and VR Primer Binding Sites
    <br>
    <a>https://www.snapgene.com/resources/plasmid-files/?set=basic_cloning_vectors&plasmid=pSB1C3</a>
    <br>
VF2 and VR are Forward and Reverse Primer Binding Sites respectively, to be used to replicate the genes of interest in the plasmid.

TEV Protease Recognition Site
    <br>
(Courtesy of Thuy-Ann Tran)
    <br>
This Protease Recognition Site is added to allow the His-tag to be snipped off of the Cas12a protein to allow proper function.
