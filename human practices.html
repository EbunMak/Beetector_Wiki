    <br>
    <h4 style="color:black;margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">How can we solve problems that are affecting beekeepers?</h4>
    <p class="body-font" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
    AFB is the most detrimental honey brood disease and is endemic to Canada due to its infectious nature, with an outbreak of AFB potentially costing up to $18 million dollars. Our goal with Beesensor is to work towards finding a solution to this devastating disease. However, we recognize that we can not achieve this goal in solitude. Therefore, we hope to work directly with farmers and collaborate on a solution.
    <br>
    <br>
    We will be making use of the human-centered design process to guide our work. We hope to engage with our end-users at every stage oBEESENSORject from ideation to implementation.
  </p>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color:black;margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">1. Understand the Problem</h2>
    <p class="body-font"style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
     In order to gain a deeper understanding of the problem at hand, we hope to interview and observe beekeepers. By learning about the end-user, first, we hope to create an accessible and viable end product.
    <br>
    <br>
    We hope to ask beekeepers what their experiences with AFB are and how comfortable they would be working with electrochemical detection methods.
    <br>
    <br>
    We plan on reaching beekeepers through the following organizations:
</p>
    <p class="body-font" style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;">
      - National Bee Diagnostic Center
      <br>
      - Calgary and District Beekeeping Association
      <br>
      - Foundation for the Preservation of Honey Bees
      <br>
    </p>
    <br>
   <h2 style="color:black;margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">2. Ideation</h2>
    <p class="body-font"style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
     After we conduct interviews, we hope to ideate potential solutions to concerns that beekeepers may have. At this stage, we hope to brainstorm as many ideas as possible. A few ideas we are considering include the following:
    </p>
    <p class="body-font"style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;">
      - Addressing the ‘secretive’ culture among farmers. To address this <b>we could work towards creating a mobile and web-based system to share data on AFB amongst neighboring beekeepers.</b> This would enable widespread information about current AFB occurrences in the community and would help prevent an outbreak and loss of hives. However due to the knowledge of the secrecy and confidentiality surrounding subjects related to sharing data on infections we plan on working alongside the provincial government and their regulations as suggested by one of our HP contacts to implement this project.
    <br>
    <br>
      - Performing a <b>cost and speed analysis of our detection system</b>. This would involve taking a closer look at the design of our aptamer. Using methods like SELEX has been seen to be expensive, thus we will take up the task of researching a less expensive, more viable way of designing our aptamers using. One way we will look into is using in silico methods, which makes the process faster and cheaper and it involves computational modeling. Other potential alternatives include transformer enhanced aptamers (TEA) - which involve a neural network model or the use of various other software such as M.A.W.S. (the software of Heidelberg 2015 iGEM).
    <br>

    <br>
    <h2 style="color:black;margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">3. Design Solutions: Rapid Prototyping </h2>
    <p class="body-font"style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
      After brainstorming, we hope to quickly build low-fidelity prototypes of solutions so that we can conceptualize our ideas and physically see them.
      <br>
      <br>
      Below is a rough prototype for the <b>mobile and web-based system</b> discussed above:
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="network1.png" style="margin-left:60%; margin-right:10%;" height=300px; width=200px alt="table">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="network2png.png" style="margin-left:-10%; margin-right:10%;" height=300px; width=500px alt="table">
        </div>
      </div>
    </p>
    <br>
  <h2 style="color:black;margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">4. Evaluate and Iterate Design: User Feedback </h2>
    <p class="body-font"style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
      Once we have created rough prototypes, we plan on <b>revisiting our end-users</b> (farmers) and asking them for their thoughts on the products/solutions that we have created. We hope to use their feedback to iterate our design and <b>fine-tune</b> it, while continually getting feedback from them every step of the way.
      <br>
      <br>
    </p>
   <h2 style="color:black;margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">5. Implementation </h2>
    <p class="body-font"style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
      At this stage, we hope to actually test out our idea in the real world. This involves developing a business plan and working towards <b>commercialization.</b> We would need to work towards adequately developing our product as numerous pre-existing methods for AFB detection already exist, we have to develop a product market and our unique value proposition. Stating what value we bring to those in the Apiculture industry and how our proposed solution is faster and more cost-effective. Lastly, <b>education</b> is essential. Understanding the passion for farming and the higher need for education in synthetic biology and sustainability, we would work to create initiatives to bring other iGEM teams, as well as older and younger populations to an increased awareness of these subjects.
