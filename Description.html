                                <p>American Foulbrood (AFB) is a disease caused by the bacterial pathogen, <em>Paenibacillus larvae</em>, which kills developing honeybee broods. AFB is endemic to Canada and is highly contagious. The estimated impact for AFB ranges from the baseline level of <strong>$0.24 million</strong> to an outbreak level of <strong>$18.47 million.</strong> It is the most harmful honeybee brood disease, as infected colonies will die in the absence of necessary treatment. Persistent AFB bacterial <strong>spores can survive on equipment for decades</strong>, while withstanding boiling water and chemical disinfectants. Hence, sensitive, accurate, and user-friendly detection of the pathogen is needed to ensure infection is identified in a timely manner.

                                  <br>
                                  This project aims to develop and evaluate a novel <strong>electrochemical biosensor</strong> to target the detection and quantitative surveillance of proteins associated with the cell wall of <em>P.larvae</em> using <strong>aptamer-functionalized gold electrode arrays</strong> by providing an electronic readout. Aptamers are short single-stranded DNA molecules that bind to target molecules with high selectivity.

                                  <br>
                                  The project will also address the pressing need to effectively <strong>detect antimicrobial resistance in <em>P.larvae</em></strong>, as antibiotics that are used to treat AFB will become null in effect due to this modification of the bacteria. Our technology will aim to develop another mechanism in order to detect antimicrobial resistance more efficiently than current methods.

                            <p>Utilizing synthetic biology, the first implementation of our project will be to accurately design the aptamers to detect surface proteins of <em>P.larvae</em> spores. The objective of the design will be to ensure the aptamer can detect a specific protein present on many <em>P.larvae</em> genotypes as possible, that are also prevalent in Canada.

                              The implementation of the electrochemical biosensor involves the aptamers being conjugated with <strong>gold electrodes</strong> via thiol chemisorption. Surface proteins of <em>P.larvae</em> bind to the aptamer and change its structure, which results in a <strong>generation of an electrical current.<strong>

                            <p>As the Albertan agricultural sector is under duress due to a rapidly changing climate, methods to ensure sustainability are critical. To successfully manage bee health, diseases must be diagnosed and monitored efficiently in accordance with industry standards. However, current monitoring methods depend on identifying the symptoms of the infection through visual inspection, which lacks the reliability and speed required to mitigate the spread. Although field tests such as commercial diagnostic kits, matchstick tests, and Holst milk tests exist for the diagnosis of AFB, these field tests lack high sensitivity. As such, a negative test result could be the outcome of the testâ€™s misdiagnosis rather than the hive being truly free of the bacterial infection. There is a pressing need for an alternative method for the reliable detection of <em>P.larvae</em> for early diagnosis and effective treatment to control the infection. Our project aims to also expand our focus to quantitative surveillance and detection of <em>P.larvae</em> in apicultural products such as wax and honey, particularly in  extraction facilities. Present studies explore the integration of antibody-based biosensors to detect bacterial pathogens. The significance of this project lies in the use of aptamers in contrast to antibodies. Aptamers are cost-effective, more stable than antibodies, and offer a versatility that is agnostic to the pathogen as they can be engineered to bind to targeted protein, cell surfaces, and more. The small size and versatility of aptamers allows efficient immobilization in monolayers. This is critical in miniaturized systems like biosensors as immobilized bioreceptors are what enables a reliable detection of the analyte. The integration of aptamers makes possible the construction of a biosensor with high specificity and sensitivity, eliminating the ambiguity felt by beekeepers around <em>P.larvae</em> diagnosis and mitigation.</p>
