    <p>
      As the Albertan agricultural sector is under duress due to a rapidly changing climate, methods to ensure sustainability are critical. To successfully manage bee health, diseases must be diagnosed and monitored efficiently in accordance with industry standards. However, current monitoring methods depend on identifying the symptoms of the infection through visual inspection, which lacks the reliability and speed required to mitigate the spread. Although field tests such as commercial diagnostic kits, matchstick tests, and Holst milk tests exist for the diagnosis of AFB, these field tests lack high sensitivity. As such, a negative test result could be the outcome of the testâ€™s misdiagnosis rather than the hive being truly free of the bacterial infection. There is a pressing need for an alternative method for the reliable detection of P. larvae for early diagnosis and effective treatment to control the infection. Present studies explore the integration of antibody-based biosensors to detect bacterial pathogens. The significance of this project lies in the use of aptamers in contrast to antibodies. Aptamers are cost-effective, more stable than antibodies, and offer a versatility that is agnostic to the pathogen as they can be engineered to bind to targeted protein, cell surfaces, and more. The small size and versatility of aptamers allows efficient immobilization in monolayers. This is critical in miniaturized systems like biosensors as immobilized bioreceptors are what enables a reliable detection of the analyte. The integration of aptamers makes possible the construction of a biosensor with high specificity and sensitivity, eliminating the ambiguity felt by beekeepers around P. larvae diagnosis and mitigation.
